# Gmail Account Creator

## Abstract📄
This project, titled “Gmail Account Creator,” was developed as part of my internship to explore browser automation for repetitive web-based tasks. The objective is to create a Python-based tool that automates the Gmail account registration process using Selenium WebDriver. The script simulates human interaction by programmatically filling out the Gmail signup form, mimicking keystrokes and clicks, and validating input fields.

To maintain compliance with privacy and security policies, the automation intentionally excludes CAPTCHA solving and phone number verification, which are either handled manually or suggested for future enhancement using third-party APIs. This prototype is developed strictly for educational and research purposes, demonstrating how automation tools can interact with complex and dynamic web interfaces.

## Technologies Used 🔧:
Python – for scripting logic

Selenium WebDriver – for browser control and form interaction

Faker – for generating realistic random data (e.g., names, usernames, birthdates)

## Key Features ✨:
Automated filling of the Gmail signup form

Randomized data generation for each account

Optional proxy support and headless browsing

Manual or third-party options suggested for CAPTCHA handling

This project highlights the potential of web automation in areas such as testing, prototyping, and data entry — while reinforcing the importance of ethical boundaries and legal compliance in automation tasks.
